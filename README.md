Welcome to my portfolio!

This project runs off of NodeJS, and in order for it to run properly there are several modules needed to run the project. You may download these modules by using the command *npm i* while in the portfolio directory and then use the command *node app* to run the server.

You may then view the portfolio on *localhost:3000*
